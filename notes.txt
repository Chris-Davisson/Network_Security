PRNG psydo random number generator
	Mac OS - True random
	BSD
		Just looking for non seq
		ICMP, TCP mayber have do not fragment and then it sets to zero

Global
	Sequential
	How to test. You have three, two talking using icmp, then spoof the third and check if its gone up by one. 

Per-Destination
	Sequential	
	How to test. Test that you're not Global, but it will be similar. Except it wont itterate from the spoof. So do multiple spoof and count

Per-Bucket
	Sequential
	How to test. Import time, time.sleep() wait for a bit then check. It should go up by a large amount. Only for ICMP/UDP stateless
		Skipping values after sleep. it adds random noise

Per-Connection
	Sequential
	How to test. If you have two computers you send from both and compare the results. If its per connection they should be different by a lot. These have to be TCP

In the writeup include a full discription of why you know. Here is the test, here is the expected results.



Send ICMP with do not frag DF=1 - if they come back random then its Linux system, ubuntu, OpenBSD or mac. if they are sequential it suggest FreeBSD, or NetBSD
Send ICMP with frag flag DF=0 - Force fragmentation
